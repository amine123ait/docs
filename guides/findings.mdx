Effectively managing vulnerability findings is crucial for improving your security posture. This guide covers the complete findings workflow.

## Findings Overview

Each finding includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Severity Rating" icon="gauge">
    Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vulnerability Type" icon="tag">
    Category (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, etc.)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evidence" icon="camera">
    Screenshots, requests, payloads
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remediation" icon="wrench">
    Step-by-step fix guidance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Severity Levels

| Level | Description | SLA Recommendation |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate exploitation risk, data breach potential | Fix within 24 hours |
| **High** | Significant security impact | Fix within 7 days |
| **Medium** | Moderate risk with mitigating factors | Fix within 30 days |
| **Low** | Minor security concern | Fix within 90 days |
| **Informational** | Best practice recommendations | Review at discretion |

## Finding Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Summary">
    Brief description of the vulnerability and its impact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Technical Details">
    - Affected endpoint
    - Vulnerable parameter
    - Attack payload used
    - Request/response data
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Proof of Concept">
    Working exploit demonstrating the vulnerability:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'https://example.com/api/users' \
      -d "id=1' OR '1'='1"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Business Impact">
    Analysis of how this vulnerability affects your business:

    - Compliance implications
    - Reputation impact
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remediation Steps">
    Specific guidance for fixing the vulnerability with code examples.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Workflow States

<Steps>
  <Step title="New">
    Newly discovered vulnerability awaiting review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmed">
    Validated by team, acknowledged as genuine issue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="In Progress">
    Fix is being developed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fixed">
    Remediation deployed, awaiting verification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verified">
    Retest confirmed the fix is effective.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filtering Findings

Use filters to focus on what matters:

```text
# Filter examples
severity:critical,high
status:new,confirmed
target:production-app
type:injection
discovered:this-week
```

## Bulk Operations

Manage multiple findings at once:

- **Bulk Status Update**: Move multiple findings to new state
- **Bulk Assignment**: Assign to team member
- **Bulk Export**: Download selected findings
- **Bulk Ignore**: Mark false positives

<Warning>
  Use bulk ignore carefully. Document reasons for ignoring findings.
</Warning>

## Retesting

After applying fixes:

1. Mark finding as **Fixed**
2. Click **Request Retest**
3. AI agent verifies the fix
4. Finding moves to **Verified** or returns to **Confirmed**

<Tip>
  Automated retesting runs during each assessment to catch regressions.
</Tip>

## False Positives

If a finding is not a genuine vulnerability:

1. Click **Mark as False Positive**
2. Add justification explaining why
3. Finding is excluded from future reports
4. AI learns from feedback to reduce similar false positives

## Integration with Issue Trackers

Export findings to:

- Jira
- GitHub Issues
- GitLab Issues
- Linear
- Custom webhooks

<Info>
  Configure integrations in **Settings** → **Integrations**.
