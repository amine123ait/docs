Phase 2 of Indie Security's assessment leverages AI agents to identify, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities across your application surface discovered in Phase 1.

## Overview

The Analysis Phase combines AI-driven testing with human analyst verification:

    A[Spider Results] --> B[AI Analysis Agent]

    D --> F[Human Verification]
    F --> G[Validated Finding]
```

## Analysis Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto Mode">
    **Best for**: Continuous security monitoring
    
    The AI agent autonomously:
    - Prioritizes high-risk endpoints
    - Chains vulnerabilities together
    - Adapts testing based on findings
    - Optimizes for coverage vs depth
    
    <Info>Recommended for CI/CD integration and regular assessments.</Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vuln Testing">
    **Best for**: Targeted security checks
    
    Focused testing against specific categories:
    - Select vulnerability types to test
    - Ideal for regression testing
    - Verify specific security controls
    
    ```bash
    # Example: Test only injection vulnerabilities
    POST /api/assessments
    {
      "mode": "vuln_testing",
      "categories": ["sqli", "xss", "cmdi"]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="APT/Adv">
    **Best for**: Comprehensive security audits
    
    Advanced persistent threat simulation:
    - Extended analysis time
    - Attack chain discovery
    - Business logic testing
    - Full OWASP coverage
    
    <Warning>May take several hours for complex applications.</Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Exploitation Evidence

Each validated finding includes comprehensive evidence:

  },
  "business_impact": "Full database access - all user records exposed",
  "remediation": "Use parameterized queries..."
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Human Analyst Verification

Critical findings receive human review:

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Detection">
    AI agent identifies potential vulnerability and creates initial finding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Validation">
    Exploit is verified through successful execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confidence Scoring">
    Finding receives confidence score (Low/Medium/High/Critical).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Human Review">
    Security analyst verifies high-impact findings and refines context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remediation Guidance">
    Detailed fix recommendations with code examples added.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-Time Monitoring

Track analysis progress from the dashboard:

- Live vulnerability count
- Coverage percentage
- Endpoints tested vs remaining
- Attack success rate

<Tip>
  Enable notifications to receive alerts when critical vulnerabilities are discovered.
