Phase 1 of Indie Security's assessment process focuses on mapping your entire application surface. This comprehensive crawling phase discovers endpoints, parameters, and application flows before security testing begins.

## Overview

The Spider Phase uses a combination of human researchers and AI crawlers to maximize coverage:

  <Card title="Human Researchers" icon="user-secret">
    Use the Burp Extension to capture traffic from manual exploration of complex workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ECHO-01 Crawler" icon="robot">
    AI-powered crawler that navigates applications intelligently and discovers hidden endpoints.

## Spider Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick">
    **Duration**: 15-30 minutes
    
    Fast surface mapping for rapid assessment. Best for:
    - Known applications with simple architecture
    - Quick verification scans
    - CI/CD pipeline integration
    
    ```bash
    # API equivalent
    POST /api/assessments
    {
      "target_id": "target_123",
      "phase": "spider",
      "mode": "quick"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Standard">
    **Duration**: 1-2 hours
    
    Thorough crawl with state-aware navigation. Best for:
    - Regular security assessments
    - Applications with moderate complexity
    - Most common use case
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Deep">
    **Duration**: Several hours
    
    Complete enumeration with exhaustive parameter fuzzing. Best for:
    - Pre-release security reviews
    - Complex enterprise applications
    - Compliance requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Burp Extension Integration

Capture authenticated sessions and complex user flows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Extension">
    Download and install the Indie Security Burp extension from the dashboard.
    
    [Download Extension →](/integrations/browser-extension)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to Session">
    Enter your API key and target ID to link the extension with your assessment.
    
    ```text
    API Key: is_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
    Target ID: target_123
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture Traffic">
    Browse your application normally. All traffic is captured and sent to the knowledge graph.
    
    <Tip>Focus on authenticated areas and complex workflows that automated crawlers might miss.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark Auth Flows">
    Use the extension to mark login sequences so the AI can replicate authentication.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Spider Results

After completion, you'll have access to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Surface Map" icon="map">
    Visual representation of discovered endpoints and their relationships.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Parameter Inventory" icon="list">
    Complete list of all discovered input points.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tech Stack Report" icon="layer-group">
    Identified technologies, frameworks, and potential attack vectors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coverage Metrics" icon="chart-pie">
    Statistics on pages visited, endpoints found, and code coverage.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Always use dedicated test accounts for crawling. Never use production admin credentials.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Maximize coverage by:**
  - Completing complex workflows manually with Burp Extension
  - Providing multiple user roles for testing
  - Including API documentation if available
</Tip>

## Next Steps

Once the Spider Phase completes, proceed to the Analysis Phase:
