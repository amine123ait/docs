<Step title="Start Spider Phase">
  Begin Phase 1 to map your application surface:
  
  1. Select your verified target
  2. Choose **Spider Mode**:
     - **Quick**: Fast surface mapping (15-30 min)
     - **Standard**: Thorough crawl (1-2 hours)
     - **Deep**: Complete enumeration (several hours)
